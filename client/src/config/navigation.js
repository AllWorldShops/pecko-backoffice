// Sidebar is a tree: top-level menus > optional sub-groups > leaf items (`to`).
// A node with no `to` and no `children` renders as an inert "coming soon" row.
// `adminOnly` groups are stripped entirely for non-admin users.
// `company` groups are shown only to users of that company (admins see all).
